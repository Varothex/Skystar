The Arduino game I am making for my robotics class. It is a Space Invaders game, that uses a joystick and a button to move and fire at enemies.

Changes:
- I added the settings menu with:
  - name settings;
  - matrix brightness settings;;
  - contrast settings;
- I added the ability to exit About early;
- I added a second level, with random generated enemies and one moving enemy;
- While playing, the LCD will show the level and player health.
