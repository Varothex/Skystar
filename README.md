The Arduino game I am making for my robotics class. It is a Space Invaders game, that uses a joystick and a button to move and fire at enemies.

Stage 1:
- I added the main menu with:
  - start;
  - score;
  - settings (button only);
  - about;
- You can play the first level;
- The highest score will be saved in EEPROM;
- The about section shows the game name, the author and has a link to this Github.

Stage 2:
- I added the settings menu with:
  - name settings;
  - matrix brightness settings;
  - LCD contrast settings;
- I added the ability to exit About early;
- I added a second level, with random generated and moving enemies;
- While playing, the LCD will show the level and player health.
